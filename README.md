**Facts about *“Descendants of the Sun”***
Believe it or not, the drama was initially planned to be based on an award-winning short story by Kim Won-Seok called “Medecins Sans Frontieres” (Doctors Without Borders). Inspired by the non-government organization the title was lifted from, the story was supposed to be about a male emergency responder who dedicated his life to humanitarian work. But when screenwriter Kim Eun Sook (“Heirs”, “Secret Garden”) was roped in for the project, she rewrote the story, ultimately changing the male lead’s character and adding more romance to stir audiences.

We don’t know but we can’t imagine DOTS without Yoo Shi-jin and Kang Mo-yeon.
